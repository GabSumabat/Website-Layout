<h2>Who’s Playing Dungeons & Dragons These Days? The Usual Fans, and Then Some.</h2>
<p>Everyone’s been playing Dungeons & Dragons without you: your co-workers, Anderson Cooper, 
Tiffany Haddish. More than 50 million people worldwide have “interacted” with D&D since it was created in the mid-1970s, 
according to its publisher, and while that number also includes movies, video games, books, television and livestreams, 
it doesn’t factor in the number of people reached over TikTok.<br>
<br>
The infamous tabletop role-playing game became a household name when “satanic panic” — 
a general fear of satanic ritual abuse that caught fire nationwide in the 1980s — began to take root in the suburbs. 
Anything with even a remote whiff of the occult, from astrology to heavy metal, was suspect. 
Since casting spells during a game could label you a devil worshiper, a nerd or something in between, 
Dungeons & Dragons was banished to the underground.</p>

<h2>Why Movies Still Matter</h2>
<p>In a new piece on Wired.com, “Could This Be the Year Movies Stopped Mattering?” Brian Raftery suggests that movies have “devolved from Culture-Conquering Pastime to merely Something to Do When the Wi-Fi’s Down,” 
and that their former centrality to the culture has been taken over by a diverse range of media events—serial television above all, but also Pokémon Go, 
“Hamilton,” YouTube memes, and visual albums such as Beyoncé’s “Lemonade.” 
The simplest refutation is that what matters is determined not by media discussion but by each person for herself; 
movies matter to me, therefore they matter.<br>
<br>
But Raftery is on to something important, even if, as I think, he comes at it backward. 
He’s right that the kinds of work that capture widespread attention and find widespread favor have changed in recent years—and he’s right that these changes are inseparable from the realm of criticism, 
the very nature of which has changed drastically in the same period. 
Raftery’s fixation on “the pop-cultural conversation” and the “zeitgeist” 
is one that’s shared by the era, by the critical community at large, and this fixation yields its own predestined results.</p>

<h2>The Association Between Video Gaming and Psychological Functioning</h2>
<p>Video gaming is an extremely popular leisure-time activity with more than two billion users worldwide (Newzoo, 2017). 
However, the media as well as professionals have underscored the potential dangers of excessive video gaming. 
With the present research, we aimed to shed light on the relation between video gaming and gamers’ psychological functioning. 
Questionnaires on personality and psychological health as well as video gaming habits were administered to 2,734 individuals (2,377 male, 357 female, Mage = 23.06, SDage = 5.91). 
Results revealed a medium-sized negative correlation between problematic video gaming and psychological functioning with regard to psychological symptoms, affectivity, coping, and self-esteem. 
Moreover, gamers’ reasons for playing and their preferred game genres were differentially related to psychological functioning with the most notable findings for distraction-motivated players as well as action game players. 
Future studies are needed to examine whether these psychological health risks reflect the causes or consequences of video gaming.</p>
